# Counsel
## Problem Statement 
### Sponsor – CounselLink

### About:
LexisNexis CounselLink is a proven solution for corporate legal departments and their law firms regardless
of the scale, scope or industry focus of the operations. Our secure and flexible cloud-based suite of software
applications integrates powerful functions for legal spend and matter management, legal holds, reporting, analytics
and benchmarking to deliver cost-effective results and value across the enterprise.

### Problem:
Corporate attorneys frequently utilize CounselLink for calendaring, tasks, and journals related to legal
matters that they are working for—and are often away from their office or away from a computer (in court, on the
road, etc.). These attorneys need an easy way to get information and make simple updates via mobile device and
avoid the burden of a full-blown web site.

### Steps to Run:
* Open Project in Xcode 7+
* Run the project (CMD+R)
